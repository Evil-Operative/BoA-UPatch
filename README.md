Notes
--
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, PLEASE BACKUP YOUR "Data" FOLDER ELSEWHERE ON YOUR COMPUTER AS A COPY. IT IS A SOUND ADVICE IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE GAME AGAIN TO RESTORE YOUR FILES BACK TO NORMAL!!

You are completely free to edit the scripts to your liking. I understand that not everybody is going to unanimously agree on all of my changes, and therefore the files are all there for you to selectively modify or exclude from the patching process. After all, who am I to judge the people who'd rather have their Ruby Skeletons appear outdoors with their older artwork? Just don't replace 'G1581.bmp' and you're all set.

Step 1
--
The .zip file comes with two components - 'BoA UPatch 1.0.0.exe' and a "Data" folder consisting of the rest of the modified files.

'BoA UPatch 1.0.0.exe' is a companion executable file which is supposed to be opened instead of the normal 'Blades of Avernum.exe' in order to change a few internal things which cannot be achieved by modifying the game scripts or graphics.

The "Data" folder mostly contains everything ready to replace the stuff in your Blades of Avernum folder, which includes the edited graphics files. But there are two things which need your manual attention. For that, please follow Step 2.

- To patch the executable file, simply drop it into your "Blades of Avernum" folder. It does not need to replace/overwrite the default executable file to work.
- To patch the "Data" folder, simply copy and paste it into your Blades of Avernum folder and let it replace/overwrite all the files. Once it is done, open the folder and follow the steps below.

Step 2
--
In the Data folder included within the .zip file (the one you have just copied and pasted over into your Blades of Avernum folder), there are two variants of 'corescendata' and 'corescendata2':

- The 'coloradjust' variant makes various flavourful colour changes to some items and creatures using the 'icon_adjust' function to make them different in looks from each other along with the necessary patches and fixes listed below. 
- The 'nocoloradjust' variant skips the "flavourful recolouring" part entirely and only carries the patches and fixes. This alternative is for those who do not care about my rainbows and glitter and want only the part that means business.

Once you have figured out which variant of the patch you wish to apply, delete the previous (unpatched) versions of 'corescendata.txt' and 'corescendata2.txt' that already exist in your 'Data' folder, then whichever variant of the patch you wish to apply, simply rename both parts of it such as, for example: 'corescendata_nocoloradjust.txt' --> 'corescendata.txt'.

Step 3 (Optional)
-- 
Similarly there are modified graphics for G812, G813 and G816 with the '_edited' suffix which add a few flavourful changes on top of the patches listed in the changelog. These changes alter the look of some spells and abilities such as giving 'Arcane Blow' spell icon a purple fill instead of the old cyan one based on how the spell looks when used on enemies, and restoring the old 'Summon Beast' ability icon from Avernum 1-3.
